Revert instructions for UI polish added on CycleTrackerPage.css

Summary of change:
- Added minimal, consistent modal actions and button styles to align with PregnancyTrackerPage.
- The block starts at the comment:
  /* Minimal, consistent actions + buttons (match Pregnancy styles) */
- It ends after the closing mobile media query.

To revert:
1) Open d:\Luneverse\wellness-app\src\pages\Styles\CycleTrackerPage.css
2) Delete the block from the line containing:
   /* Minimal, consistent actions + buttons (match Pregnancy styles) */
   through the end of this media query block:
   @media (max-width: 768px) { ... }
3) Save the file.

Optional quick-undo with find/replace:
- Find this exact starting line:
  /* Minimal, consistent actions + buttons (match Pregnancy styles) */
- Delete everything from that line down to and including:
  }
  (the final closing brace of the @media (max-width: 768px) block)

Classes introduced (safe to remove on revert):
- .modal-content, .modal-actions, .cancel-btn, .delete-btn, .save-btn, .close-btn

Note:
- No HTML/JSX changes were made; only CSS. Removing this block restores the previous look.
